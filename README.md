# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates a basic Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application.

## Pipeline Stages:
1. **Checkout Code** - Downloads code from GitHub
2. **Build Status** - Simulates build process

## Jenkins Setup:
- Jenkins running on: http://localhost:8080
- Pipeline job: `nodejs-pipeline-demo`
- Source: GitHub repository

## What I Learned:
- How to set up Jenkins pipelines
- Creating Jenkinsfile for CI/CD
- Configuring Jenkins jobs
- Basic pipeline stages and structure

## Screenshots:
- Jenkins dashboard with pipeline
- Successful build output
- Pipeline stage execution
